This macro is intended for testing normally interactive functions
by simulating input. If BODY tries to read more input events than
KEYS provides, `keyboard-quit' is invoked (by means of appending
multple C-g keys to KEYS). This is to ensure that BODY will never
block waiting for input, since this macro is intended for
noninteractive use. As such, BODY should not invoke
`keyboard-quit' under normal operation, and KEYS should not
include C-g, or this macro will interpret it as reading past the
end of input."
  ;; It would be better to detect end-of-input by overriding
  ;; `read-event' to throw an error, since theoretically C-g could be
  ;; rebound to something other than `keyboard-quit'. But apparently

  ;; `read-event' has no effect on those. So the suboptimal solution
